# MobilePhone

The application displays one window in which there is an input field (for entering a phone number) and a colored inscription. The label can be in two states: green text "Ok" and red "Not Ok".

If you enter a mobile phone number in the format +11111111111 (the "+" sign and any 11 digits) in the input field, then the color inscription should show the truth. For other string formats, there should be an inscription "Not Ok".
